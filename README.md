# *Software* for Vim

## Measure your coding activity in real time 

*Software* shows you your coding activity to help you increase flow, decrease interrupts, and improve work-life balance. 

It takes just a minute to install our plugin for Vim (see the [setup instructions](https://www.software.com/text-editors-and-ides/vim)).

## Commands

* `:SoftwareKPM` - get the last minute's KPM and code time for the active session
* `:SoftwareLogin` - log in to Software.com

### See your coding intensity

Our plugin for Vim features a status bar that shows your keystrokes per minute (KPM) for your last minute of activity. We show a rocket icon if your KPM is equal to or above your average KPM per day for the last 90 days--a subtle reminder of your relative coding focus and intensity.

### Time tracking

Longer sessions are generally more productive because we can maintain context and more easily retain logical constructs related to our code. In the status bar, we show a circle with a partial fill (either 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%) to indicate the duration of your current session vs. your average over the last 90 days.

### Quantify your coding

In addition to KPM and time, we also measure time spent by project, lines of code, characters added/deleted, and your current Spotify or iTunes track. We distill this data into interesting "datagrams" that you can view in your account at [app.software.com](https://app.software.com).

### Safe, secure, and free

All of our plugins are safe, secure, and free. We do not process, send, or store your proprietary code. We only track productivity-related data, and we make it easy to see the data we collect.
